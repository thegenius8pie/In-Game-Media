# In-Game-Media
Social media site for creators and those inspired to create to connect and stay in the know!

# Project Name: In-Game Media Platform

## Description
This is a project that will bring media creators of all sorts so much closer to their team fanbase and much more. I want this site to be a social media chat based site where people can send code back and forth to each other, talk games, comics, and other nerdy topics, and even at the same time work towards your career in becoming something greater! Us techies and inspired minds alike really don't have a home that has it all so my first project will be going through the struggles of why and how to fix it for all of us!
Please be kind as this is my very first project so even I don't have big hopes for it but I am going to put in my 110% effort!
